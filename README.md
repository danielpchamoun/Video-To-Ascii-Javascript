# Features

### Youtube and .mp4 Support

Video downloads are available from YouTube through the python library pytube, allowing for easier access to convert your favorite videos.
Alternatively, use a local .mp4 file not from YouTube.

### Video Trimming

To shorten a length video into a smaller file, it is recommended to trim your video to only the important parts. This can be done using the video trimming tool built into VTAJ.

Similarly, if you would like to decrease the resolution of the ASCII video, use the scale factor for easy conversion. Note the default value is at 0.08 to allow for embedding as otherwise each pixel would represents an ascii character (lots of data to store so scale it down).
